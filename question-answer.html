          <p>1: Click the images you want from the bottom left box and this will cause them to move to the box above (this means you have selected them to trade).</p>
          <p>2: Then click the images in the bottom right box that you wish to trade for the item, these will too move up into their top box (meaning you have also selected them).</p>
          <p>3: Make sure that the emearld numbers on both top boxes are the same (so that this is a fair trade).</p>
          <p>4: Now the accept button beneath these two boxes should be green.</p>
          <p>5: Click Accept Trade and there you go the trade is compleated.</p>
